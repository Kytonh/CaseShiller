# CaseShiller

### Objective
Case-Shiller index is one of the most common used index in real-estate market for house price analysis. This project will be focusing on analyzing the trends and changes of the Case-Shiller index and make prediction for the furture index.


### Procedures

There will be four steps in this project

1. Get the both nation-wide Case-Shiller index data from "https://fred.stlouisfed.org/" with Python
2. Build forecasting models for the furture case-shiller index with Python with three forecasting algorithms(Simple Moving Average, Exponential Moving Average)
3. Testing the models' performance(Absolute Error) for SMA models
4. Visualize the models with Python and Tableau
